# Analysis of Student Spending

 `Project Goal:` To explore and analyze the spending patterns of college students, identify key trends, and provide data-driven recommendations for financial management.

`Tools:` Python, Jupyter Notebook

`Libraries:` NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

`Data Source:` the "student_spending.xlsx" file was obtained on Kaggle.com. 

## Data Cleaning:
1. Removed duplicate records.
2. Categorized features (numeric/non-numeric).
3. Imputed missing values
4. Removed Y outliers using

## Data Analysis and Visualization

`Statistical Analysis`
 
 1. Conducted a detailed statistical analysis to gain insights into students' spending habits in relation to gender, school year, and income level.
 2. Calculated key statistical metrics, including mean, median, and standard deviation, to summarize and understand the data distribution and variability.

`Data Visualization`

 1. Bar Plots and Bar Graphs: Utilized Matplotlib's pyplot and Seaborn to create bar plots and bar graphs, highlighting trends and comparisons between different categories.
 2. Pie Charts: Employed pie charts to illustrate the proportional distribution of spending categories or demographic segments.
